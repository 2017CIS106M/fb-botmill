# Contributing to FB-BotMill

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to FB-Botmill.

**<h3>General Issues, Concerns or Inquiries</h3>**
Our source is open to anyone who's interested in making Bot's using the beautiful Java Programming Language and when we say it's open source, it is literally open. You can just download the actual code and use it as per our licensing terms. All we want in addition to our terms is that you give us your feedback. We passionately created this framework and we want to improve it the best way we can - but we can only do that if you help us. If you found any bugs, issues, ideas or even inquiries, raise a ticket [here](https://github.com/BotMill/fb-botmill/issues).

**<h3>Code Contributor</h3>**
Interested in contributing to our project? We will always be open to your pull requests! Be sure to check our code of conduct first before making any changes. Even it's all open source, we need to make sure that our code is well documented and complies with the standards.

- Introduce/Code your heart out to implement your idea.

**<h3>Bot Examples</h3>**
We would really appreciate it if you can share the bots that you made using our framework, just like the many people who ask us to show case theirs.
